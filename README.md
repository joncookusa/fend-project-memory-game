# Memory Game Project

The memory game project replicates the classic card game where by a 4 x 4 grid of 16 cards, comprising of eight matching pairs, are placed face down. The player then flips two of the cards face up. If the cards match, they remain in the face up position. If they do not match, they revert back to the face down position and the player tries again. When then player has successfully matched all the 8 pairs, the game is over and the player is presented with the number of turn attempts, a star rating and the time taken.
